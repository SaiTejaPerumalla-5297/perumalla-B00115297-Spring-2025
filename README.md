Updates:
During data pre processing after executing the normalise images script, the expected result was creating a normalised images for test, train, valid folders with labels.
But I have encountered a problem where the labels were not created but the images were normalised. Henceforth I have made a new file named fix_labels.ipynb to create the labels for the images.
